About
=====

triggerd is a Python script that is used to trigger an event or notification upon the output of a command

An event file containing the trigger criteria is created. Ideally, you'll create an entry in cron to execute ``triggerd EVENTFOLDER`` on a regular basis. If the command status or output matches the trigger criteria, a trigger event or notification is executed and the event file is marked triggered.

triggerd is perfect for querying a webpage for matching text or anything of the sort. I originally created it for use with a modified version of urlwatch to notify me upon certain changes to webpages, however the potential uses are limitless.

The script was originally written in Bash shell script, a copy of which is included in this repository as ``triggerd.sh``. It is nearly syntactically identical to the Python version (it only lacks the --verbose option). It is a great alternative if Python 3 is not available in your environment.

Installation
============

The easiest way to install triggerd is via pip (assuming it is installed).

::

  pip3 install --user triggerd

FYI: The shell version of triggerd will be included in your local bin folder as ``triggerd.sh``

Usage
===========

triggerd is controlled via configuration files called event files. You can execute it as follows:

::

  triggerd FILE1 FILE2 FILE3

Or against entire directories of event files:

::

  triggerd DIRECTORY


You can test your event file configuration without actually executing it:

::

  triggerd --verify FILE

The Python version of triggerd features a --verbose option to display additional execution details:

::

  triggerd --verbose FILE


Event Files
===========

Here is a sample event file:

::

  COMMAND=curl -s google.com | grep -q google
  EVENT_NAME=Google
  MATCH_CONTENT=0
  MATCH_CRITERIA=eq
  STATUS=enabled
  TEST_TYPE=status
  TRIGGER_CUSTOM=notify-send "Google is alive!"

**TEST_TYPES** options:

::


  arithmetic
  content
  status (exit code)

**MATCH_CRITERIA** for arithmetic and status tests:

::

  eq
  ge
  gt
  le
  lt
  ne

**MATCH_CRITERIA** for content tests:

::

  contains
  does_not_contain
  does_not_match
  matches

**STATUS** indicates whether the event is active:

::

  enabled
  disabled
  triggered (this will be set by triggerd upon a trigger event)

Triggers
========

Triggers may be specified in the event file via ``TRIGGER_CUSTOM`` for the exact shell command to execute.

Trigger may also be specified via ``TRIGGER_NAMED`` for the name of a trigger template.

i.e. ``TRIGGER_NAMED=special``

The trigger templates may be defined in ``$HOME/.config/scripts/triggerd/triggers.conf``

ie. ``special=notify-send --icon=$HOME/.config/scripts/triggerd/icons/special.png --urgency=critical "triggerd: $EVENT_NAME" "special event was triggered!"``
